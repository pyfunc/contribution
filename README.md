 Here are a few steps you can follow to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Verify Flask Installation:**
   Ensure that Flask is installed in your virtual environment:
   ```sh
   . .venv/bin/activate  # Activate your virtual environment
   pip show flask        # Show information about the flask package
   ```

   If Flask is not installed, you can install it using:
   ```sh
   pip install flask
   ```

2. **Check Flask Module Location:**
   Double-check the location of the `flask` module. The error message shows that it is located under:
   ```
   /home/tom/github/multigit-com/python1/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/flask/__init__.py
   ```
   Ensure there are no conflicting installations of `flask` within different projects or virtual environments.

3. **Correct Import Statement:**
   Ensure that your `codialog/app.py` file has the correct import statement:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, jsonify, render_template
   ```

4. **Environment Activation:**
   Make sure you have activated the correct virtual environment where Flask is installed:
   ```sh
   . /home/tom/github/multigit-com/python1/.venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Python Version:**
   Ensure you are using a compatible version of Python with Flask. Flask should work with Python 3.6 and above.

6. **Clean Up Virtual Environment:**
   Sometimes residual files or misconfigurations in the environment can cause issues. You might want to recreate your virtual environment:
   ```sh
   deactivate  # Deactivate current environment
   rm -rf .venv  # Remove the existing virtual environment
   python3 -m venv .venv  # Create a new virtual environment
   . .venv/bin/activate  # Activate the new environment
   pip install flask  # Install Flask in the new environment
   ```

7. **Check `__init__.py` File:**
   Verify that the `__init__.py` file in the `flask` module directory is not corrupted or empty.

8. **Look for Typos or Naming Conflicts:**
   Ensure that there are no local files or directories named `flask.py` or `flask` within your project that might shadow the installed package.
